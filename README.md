### Day 2 – Stream API & Collectors
**Date:** 28-Jan-2026

> Studied Java Stream API fundamentals and lazy evaluation.
> Practiced stream creation from collections, arrays, and generators.
> Used intermediate operations:
> - filter, map, flatMap, sorted, distinct, limit.
> Applied terminal operations:
> - collect, forEach, reduce, count, findFirst.
> Learned Collectors usage:
> - toList, toSet, joining, groupingBy, partitioningBy, summarizingInt.
> Practiced parallel streams and performance considerations.
> Implemented a mini project and Java 8 workshop using Streams and Collectors:
> Appointment filtering, grouping, counting, and sorting.
> Solved practice problems and committed all work.
