## Week 7: Design Patterns & Multithreading

### Day 1 – GoF Design Patterns (Library Management System)
**Date:** 31-Jan-2026 (Focus: Scalable and loosely coupled application design using Design Patterns)

> - Studied core GoF Design Patterns to design clean, maintainable, and reusable software systems.

> - Implemented the Singleton Pattern to ensure only one instance of the Library Catalog exists across the entire application.

> - Used the Factory Pattern to dynamically create different user types such as Student, Faculty, and Librarian without tight coupling.

> - Applied the Observer Pattern so users automatically receive notifications when new books are added to the catalog.

> - Practiced the Builder Pattern to construct Book objects with optional attributes like author, edition, and genre in a flexible way.

> - Learned how multiple design patterns work together inside one real-world system.

> -Focused on writing modular, extensible, and object-oriented code following best practices.

> - Library Management System

> - Applied these patterns to manage books, users, and notifications efficiently. Designed the system to simulate real-world library behavior with proper architecture and clean structure.

### Day 2 –  Multithreading & Concurrency
**Date:** 02-02-2026 (Focus: Thread creation, synchronization, lifecycle management, and scheduling)

> - Studied Java multithreading concepts to execute multiple tasks simultaneously and improve performance.

> - Learned thread creation using both Thread class and Runnable interface.

> - 0ol.Practiced join() to make the main thread wait for child threads.

> - Used sleep() to simulate real-time task execution.

> - Implemented synchronization to prevent race conditions while accessing shared resources.

> - Explored thread priorities and scheduling behavior.

> - Understood thread lifecycle states such as NEW, RUNNABLE, TIMED_WAITING, and TERMINATED.
