> Studied SQL RDBMS industry standards and database design principles.

> Revised normalization forms:
> - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF

> Learned types of keys:
> - Primary, Foreign, Candidate, Composite, Unique

> Practiced all major SQL command groups:
> - DDL, DML, DQL, DCL, TCL

> Implemented joins:
> - INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF

> Worked with complex queries:
> - Subqueries and correlated subqueries
> - EXISTS and derived tables

> Learned advanced SQL concepts:
> - Window functions
> - CTE and recursive CTE

> Transactions and isolation levels

> Studied indexing in detail:
> - Primary, Unique, Composite, Full-Text indexes
> - Clustered and non-clustered indexes

> - Analyzed query performance using:
> - EXPLAIN and execution plans
> - Applied indexing best practices and optimization rules.
> - Solved SQL practice exercises and tuning scenarios.

**Day 35 – DBMS Fundamentals, Indexing & SQL Best Practices**
**Date:** 09-Feb-2026

> Studied JDBC architecture and workflow.
> Learned core JDBC components:
> - DriverManager, Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, ResultSet
> Established MySQL database connection using JDBC driver.
> Implemented CRUD operations:
> - INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
> Compared Statement vs PreparedStatement and learned SQL injection prevention.
> Practiced ResultSet processing and data retrieval.
> Learned transaction management concepts:
> - Auto-commit, commit, rollback, savepoints
> Followed JDBC best practices:
> - Try-with-resources
> - Proper exception handling
> - Secure query execution
> Introduced DAO and DTO design patterns for database applications.

> Solved JDBC practice programs and committed all work.
